== 3scale and {sso-name} Integration

Every OIDC secured _application_ in 3scale needs a corresponding SSO client in the {sso-name-short} realm.
The details between the API managed _application_ should match the details of the corresponding SSO _client_.

Subsequently, it is important to automate the synchronization between 3scale and {sso-name-short}.

The _zync_ component in 3scale is the component responsible for this synchronization.
Its purpose is to synchronize API managed _applications_ to external systems such as {sso-name-short}.
It does so in an automated manner by pushing updates to external systems every time a state change occurs within an API managed _application_.

In this section, you create a SSO client in the realm of your {sso-name-short} server that will be leveraged by the _zync_ component of the 3scale API management platform.
Zync will use the new SSO client to synchronize between OIDC secured _applications_ and their corresponding SSO _clients_ in {sso-name-short}.

The name of this new SSO client will be called:  _zync-sso_.
The _zync-sso_ client will be configured to utilize the OIDC _client credentials_ flow.
Via the _zync-sso_ client, the zync component will retrieve an access token that then allows for the creation and update of new SSO clients through the {sso-name-short} API.

[NOTE]
====
Within OIDC and OAuth, the Client Credentials Flow is used for server-to-server scenarios. In this scenario, the client application (in our case the 3scale zync component) is a confidential client that’s acting on its own, not on behalf of the user. It’s more of a service account type of scenario. It’s a back channel flow to obtain an access token using the client’s credentials.
A good explanation of the different OIDC flows can be found here: https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/06/21/what-the-heck-is-oauth

== Create API in {3scale-name} and Configure to Use OpenID Connect

In this section of the lab you configure an API on 3scale secured with OpenID Connect.

The backend for this new API is the Quarkus application which you leveraged in previous labs as well.

. Log in to {3scale-name} using your configured IdP.
. Navigate to *Dashboard*, select the *Products* tab and click *New Product*.
. On the _New Product_ page:
* Select *Define manually*
* *Name*: `RHOAM API OIDC`
* *System Name*: `rhoam_api_oidc`
. Select *Create Product* to create the API.
. Create an application plan for the new API:
* *Name*: `RHOAM OIDC Basic Plan`
* *System Name*: `rhoam_oidc/basic`
. Publish the application plan.
. Add a backend to the API. Click on the *Integration -> Backends* link in the menu. On the backend page, click *Add Backend*. Select the `rhoam-openapi Backend` backend, and set the path to `/`. Click *Add to Product* to add the backend to the API.
. The default mapping rules allow all `GET` operations, which is sufficient for this lab.
. On the *Settings* page of the API:
* Select `APIcast 3scale managed`.
* Leave the *Staging Public Base URL* and *Production Public Base URL* to the default values.
. In the *Authentication* section, select `OpenID Connect`.
. Scroll down and fill in the details for the authentication settings:
* *OpenID Connect Issuer Type*: `Red Hat Single Sign-On`
* Set the value of *OpenID Connect Issuer* to the URL of your realm on RH-SSO, to which you add the _zync_sso_ client ID and secret for authentication. +
+
-----
https://<ZYNC_SSO_CLIENT_ID>:<ZYNC_SSO_CLIENT_SECRET>@<RHSSO_HOSTNAME>/auth/realms/<SSO_REALM>
-----
+
** `<ZYNC_SSO_CLIENT_ID>`: client ID of the SSO client you created in the previous section. 
** `<ZYNC_SSO_CLIENT_SECRET>`: client secret of the SSO client you created in the previous section.
** `<RHSSO_HOSTNAME>`: Host name of the {sso-name-short} server. Something like `keycloak-redhat-rhoam-user-sso.apps.<OPENSHIFT_BASE_URL>`.
** `<SSO_REALM>`: name of the realm you created previously. 
+
[NOTE]
=====
This URL serves the following purposes:

* Provides zync with the URL to add or update SSO clients in RH-SSO.
* Provides APIcast with the URL to RH-SSO to retrieve the public key of the RH-SSO realm in order to verify the JWT token.
=====
* In the *OIDC AUTHORIZATION FLOW* section, ensure that the `Authorization Code Flow` checkbox is checked.
+
image::images/lab4-3scale-api-oidc-settings.png[3scale API OIDC Settings, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]
* Scroll down and change *Credentials Location* to _As HTTP Headers_.
+
image::images/lab4-3scale-api-credentials-location.png[3scale API Credentials Location, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Click *Update Product* to update the settings.

== Create Application

In this section of the lab you create an application for the _RHOAM API OIDC_ API.

. Log in to {3scale-name} using your configured IdP.
. Navigate to *Audience -> Accounts -> Listing*, and click *Create* to create a new account.
. On the _Create New Account Page_, enter the following values:
* *Username*: `test-oidc`
* *Email*: a valid email address
* *Password*: an easy to remember password
* *Organization/Group Name*: `TestOIDC`
. Click *Create* to create the user and account.
. Create a new _Application_ for the TestOIDC account.
* *Application Plan*: `RHOAM OIDC Basic Plan`

. Set the redirect URL to `https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback`.
+
image::images/lab4-3scale-api-oidc-callback-url.png[3scale API OIDC callback, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]
+
* This redirect URL will become useful later in this lab when you test using the _Authorization Code_ OAuth2 flow.
* Notice that the API Credentials for this application do no consist of a user key, but rather a Client ID and a Client Secret.

== Verify Application Client in {sso-name-short}

As a result of creating the application, the 3scale zync component has created a new realm client for your realm in the {sso-name-short} server.

. Log in to RH-SSO, select the 3scale realm and navigate to the *Clients* section.
. Notice that a new client has been created with a client ID corresponding to the client ID of the _TestOIDC RHOAM App_ application in 3scale.
+
image::images/lab4-sso-zync-client-created.png[RH-SSO Client created by Zync, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]
. Click the *Edit* button for the new client.
* The client name corresponds to the name of the application in 3scale.
* The redirect URL matches the URL you specified in the API credentials.
* _Standard Flow_ is enabled, which matches the _Authorization Code Flow_ setting specified in the API definition.

== Test the OIDC Secured API

=== Promote to Staging and Production APIcast

. In the 3scale Admin Portal, navigate to *Product: RHOAM API OIDC -> Integration -> Configuration*.
. Promote the API to the staging and production APIcast.
